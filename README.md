# Discovering Reliable Functional Dependencies

This is the implementation for discovering reliable dependencies from data using the permutation-based (also known as reliable) fraction of information. For more information you can check the following papers:
- Discovering Functional Dependencies from Mixed-Type Data, Panagiotis Mandros, David Kaltenpoth, Mario Boley, Jilles Vreeken, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD conference (KDD’20)
- Discovering Reliable Dependencies from Data: Hardness and Improved Algorithms, Panagiotis Mandros, Mario Boley, Jilles Vreeken, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'18) 
- Discovering Reliable Approximate Functional Dependencies , Panagiotis Mandros, Mario Boley, Jilles Vreeken, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD conference (KDD’17)

## How to run

To discover reliable dependencies in data, refer to the readme.pdf file in the discoveringDependencies folder
