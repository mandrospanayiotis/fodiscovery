This file contains instructions on how to discover reliable dependencies from data.

FoDiscovery.jar is the executable with all dependencies attached.

valid dataset formats:
	-arff
	-xarf (https://bitbucket.org/realKD/realkd/wiki/model/data/xarf)
	-csv (with or without header)

arguments:
	Obligatory
		-DATASET  (dataset filename)
		-OUTPUTFOLDER  (output folder)
	Optional
		-TARGET (the index of the target variable (starting from 1), default is the last column)
		-K		(number of results the user wants, default is 1)
		-BINS   (number of bins for equal-frequency discretization, default is 5)
		-OPT    (bounding function to use. MON, SPC, CHAIN for f_mon, f_spc, and both respectively. Default is CHAIN )
		For greedy only
			-BEAMWIDTH (the size of the beam, default is 1)
			-OPT    (beam has an additional option which is NONE, for no pruning at all)
		For Branch-and-bound with OPUS only
			-ALPHA   (alpha-approximation to use, default is 1 which yields the optimal solution)

The code creates an output file in the -OUTPUTFOLDER folder, with the dataset name, alpha used, k for top-k and a timestamp of the run. The file contains various statistics of the search, and the top-k patterns discovered.  Every pattern contains the entropy of the target, the mutual information, the expected mutual information under the null, the reliable fraction of information score, and the uncorrected reliable fraction of information score. 

For data attributes that are not categoric, equal-frequency discretization is applied.

Examples
	single experiment
		Branch and Bound:
			For the example dataset abalone.arff located in this folder, the following command

				nohup java -cp  FoDiscovery.jar de.mpiinf.fodiscovery.singleexp.FoOPUS -DATASET abalone.arff -OUTPUTFOLDER exampleOutput/ -K 5 -ALPHA 1 -OPT CHAIN &

			produces the output found in the exampleOutput folder with 5 dependencies returned. An example pattern output is the following:

				FunctionalPatternImplementation(([Shell_weight, Sex, Shucked_weight],[Rings]), [Co-domain entropy: 3.602136152750491,mutual information: 0.850694568131174,expected mutual information: 0.17471427784508936,fraction of information: 0.23616391276093418,reliable fraction of information: 0.18766094939801897])

			which means that we have the three dimensional descriptor [Shell_weight, Sex, Shucked_weight] for the target [Rings] with reliable fraction of information score 0.187.

		Greedy:	
			If Branch and Bound is slow, one can try the greedy algorithm that is not optimal, but in practice yields close to optimal solutions fast. The following command

				nohup java -cp  FoDiscovery.jar de.mpiinf.fodiscovery.singleexp.FoBeam -DATASET abalone.arff -OUTPUTFOLDER exampleOutput/ -K 5 -OPT NONE &

			produces the output found in the exampleOutput folder with 5 dependencies returned. An example pattern output is the following:

				FunctionalPatternImplementation(([Shucked_weight, Shell_weight, Sex],[Rings]), [Co-domain entropy: 3.602136152750491,mutual inf.: 0.850694568131174,expected mutual information: 0.17471427784508925,fraction of information: 0.23616391276093412,reliable fraction of information: 0.18766094939801897])

			which means that we have the three dimensional descriptor [Shell_weight, Sex, Shucked_weight] for the target [Rings] with reliable fraction of information score 0.187. As we see, the result is the same as in the BnB algorithm.

	multiple experiments
		The implementation offers the option to run multiple experiments using the classes FoOPUSs and FoBeams that can run multiple OPUS and Beam experiments respectively. It requires two obligatory arguments:
			-INPUT (a file that contains one single experiment per line, using the same arguments as above)
			-OUTPUTFOLDER  (output folder to write the output files (one for every experiment in the input file))
		Example
			Let us assume that we want to run two times the OPUS algorithm to discover dependencies with different approximation guarantees. We create an input file named, e.g., abaloneDifferentAlphas.txt looking like this:
				-DATASET abalone.arff -K 5 -ALPHA 1 
				-DATASET abalone.arff -K 5 -ALPHA 0.8
			Note that you cannot specify an output folder for each experiment. All output files are written in the same output folder.
			We run the experiment with the following command
				nohup java -cp  FoDiscovery.jar de.mpiinf.fodiscovery.multipleexp.FoOPUSs -INPUT abaloneDifferentAlphas.txt -OUTPUTFOLDER exampleOutput/
			This will create two files in the output folder, one for each run
